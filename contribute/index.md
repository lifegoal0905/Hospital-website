# Interested in Contributing to HospitalRun?
Currently, there are a few ways to contribute. As the project grows, they'll be more. We hope you catch the vision for what we're doing together and get involved in whatever way you can.

## Become a Code Contributor
HospitalRun is proudly built with technologies like [Ember](http://emberjs.com), [Node](http://nodejs.org), and [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/). If you work with those technologies already or have software development experience and are interested in learning them, consider [contributing to HospitalRun](https://github.com/HospitalRun/hospitalrun-frontend/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md). If you're serious about contributing, we also encourage you to [join our Slack](https://hospitalrun-slackin.herokuapp.com/), where the majority of the project communication happens.

## Make a financial contribution to support the development and deployment of HospitalRun
[Contribute on our Open Collective page!](https://opencollective.com/hospitalrun) and thank you for helping support some of the costs around the project.

If you'd like to make a special financial contribution to support the project, email Joel Worrall at <mailto:joel@hospitalrun.io> to discuss how you can assist.
